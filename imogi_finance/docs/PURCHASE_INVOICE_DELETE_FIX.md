# Fix: Purchase Invoice & Payment Entry Deletion Error with Expense Request Link

## Problem

When attempting to delete a **draft Purchase Invoice (PI)** or **Payment Entry (PE)** that is linked to an Expense Request (ER), ERPNext throws a `LinkExistsError`:

```
frappe.exceptions.LinkExistsError: Cannot delete or cancel because Purchase Invoice 
ACC-PINV-2026-00017 is linked with Expense Request ER-2026-000031
```

Similarly for Payment Entry:
```
frappe.exceptions.LinkExistsError: Cannot delete or cancel because Payment Entry 
ACC-PAY-2026-00123 is linked with Expense Request ER-2026-000031
```

This error occurs even when:
- The PI/PE is still in **draft status** (not submitted)
- There is **no downstream document** created yet
- User should be able to delete draft documents freely

## Root Cause

Both Expense Request and Payment Entry have bidirectional Link fields:

**For Purchase Invoice:**
1. **Purchase Invoice** has field `imogi_expense_request` (Link to Expense Request)
2. **Expense Request** has field `linked_purchase_invoice` (Link to Purchase Invoice)

**For Payment Entry:**
1. **Payment Entry** has field `imogi_expense_request` (Link to Expense Request)  
2. **Expense Request** has field `linked_payment_entry` (Link to Payment Entry)

This creates **bidirectional links** that ERPNext enforces strictly. Even though these links are meant to be informational/read-only, ERPNext treats them as hard constraints that prevent deletion.

## Solution

Implemented a two-part fix for **both Purchase Invoice and Payment Entry**:

### 1. Add `before_delete` Hook (Prevention)

Added a new event handler `before_delete` that sets the `ignore_links` flag before ERPNext performs link validation.

**For Purchase Invoice:**
```python
def before_delete(doc, method=None):
    """Set flag to ignore link validation before deletion.
    
    This prevents LinkExistsError when deleting draft PI that is linked to ER.
    The actual link cleanup happens in on_trash.
    """
    if doc.get("imogi_expense_request"):
        doc.flags.ignore_links = True
```

**For Payment Entry:**
```python
def before_delete(doc, method=None):
    """Set flag to ignore link validation before deletion.
    
    This prevents LinkExistsError when deleting draft PE that is linked to ER.
    The actual link cleanup happens in on_trash.
    """
    expense_request, branch_request = _resolve_expense_request(doc)
    if expense_request or branch_request:
        doc.flags.ignore_links = True
```

This flag tells ERPNext to skip the link existence check, similar to what we do in `before_cancel`.

### 2. Enhanced `on_trash` Hook (Cleanup)

Updated the `on_trash` handler to **clear the link fields** in Expense Request before deletion completes.

**For Purchase Invoice - clear `linked_purchase_invoice`:**
```python
def on_trash(doc, method=None):
    """Clear links from Expense Request before deleting PI to avoid LinkExistsError."""
    expense_request = doc.get("imogi_expense_request")
    
    if expense_request and frappe.db.exists("Expense Request", expense_request):
        updates = {}
        
        # Clear pending_purchase_invoice if it matches
        request_links = get_expense_request_links(expense_request, include_pending=True)
        if request_links.get("pending_purchase_invoice") == doc.name:
            updates["pending_purchase_invoice"] = None
        
        # Clear linked_purchase_invoice if it matches (THIS IS THE KEY FIX)
        current_linked = frappe.db.get_value("Expense Request", expense_request, "linked_purchase_invoice")
        if current_linked == doc.name:
            updates["linked_purchase_invoice"] = None
        
        # Update workflow state to reflect the cleared link
        if updates or True:
            current_links = get_expense_request_links(expense_request)
            next_status = get_expense_request_status(current_links)
            updates["workflow_state"] = next_status
            
            frappe.db.set_value("Expense Request", expense_request, updates)
            frappe.db.commit()  # Commit immediately to ensure link is cleared
```

**For Payment Entry - clear `linked_payment_entry`:**
```python
def on_trash(doc, method=None):
    """Clear links from Expense Request before deleting PE to avoid LinkExistsError."""
    expense_request, branch_request = _resolve_expense_request(doc)
    
    if expense_request and frappe.db.exists("Expense Request", expense_request):
        updates = {}
        
        # Clear linked_payment_entry if it matches (THIS IS THE KEY FIX)
        current_linked = frappe.db.get_value("Expense Request", expense_request, "linked_payment_entry")
        if current_linked == doc.name:
            updates["linked_payment_entry"] = None
        
        # Update workflow state based on remaining links
        request_links = get_expense_request_links(expense_request)
        next_status = get_expense_request_status(request_links)
        updates["workflow_state"] = next_status
        
        frappe.db.set_value("Expense Request", expense_request, updates)
        frappe.db.commit()  # Commit immediately to ensure link is cleared
```

### 3. Register Hook in `hooks.py`

```python
"Purchase Invoice": {
    # ... other hooks ...
    "before_delete": "imogi_finance.events.purchase_invoice.before_delete",
    "on_trash": "imogi_finance.events.purchase_invoice.on_trash",
}

"Payment Entry": {
    # ... other hooks ...
    "before_delete": "imogi_finance.events.payment_entry.before_delete",
    "on_trash": ["imogi_finance.events.payment_entry.on_trash"],
}
```

## Behavior After Fix

### Draft Purchase Invoice
✅ **Can be deleted** even when linked to Expense Request
- `before_delete` sets `ignore_links = True` to bypass link check
- `on_trash` clears `linked_purchase_invoice` field in ER
- Workflow state updates back to "Approved" (ready for new PI)

### Draft Payment Entry
✅ **Can be deleted** even when linked to Expense Request
- `before_delete` sets `ignore_links = True` to bypass link check
- `on_trash` clears `linked_payment_entry` field in ER
- Workflow state updates to "PI Created" or "Approved" based on remaining links

### Submitted Purchase Invoice / Payment Entry
❌ **Cannot be deleted** - must be cancelled first (existing ERPNext behavior)
- User must cancel the document first
- Then deletion will work using the same mechanism

### Expense Request State After Deletion
**After PI deletion:**
- `linked_purchase_invoice`: Cleared (set to None)
- `pending_purchase_invoice`: Cleared if matched
- `workflow_state`: Reverts to "Approved"
- Status: Can create new PI

**After PE deletion:**
- `linked_payment_entry`: Cleared (set to None)
- `workflow_state`: Reverts to "PI Created" (if PI exists) or "Approved" (if no PI)
- Status: Can create new PE

## Testing

Created test file `test_pi_delete_with_er_link.py` with test cases:

1. ✅ Delete draft PI with ER link (should succeed)
2. ✅ Submitted PI requires cancel first (should fail direct delete)
3. ✅ ER link fields are properly cleared after deletion
4. ✅ ER workflow state updates correctly

Run tests:
```bash
bench --site [site-name] run-tests imogi_finance.test_pi_delete_with_er_link
```

   - New test file for PI deletion validation

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### Option 1: Change Field Type (NOT Implemented)
Change `linked_purchase_invoice` from `Link` to `Data` fieldtype.
- ❌ Loses ERPNext UI benefits (clickable links, validation)
- ❌ Requires DocType schema migration
- ❌ May break existing code that depends on Link behavior

### Option 2: Use Custom Field Instead (NOT Implemented)
Store PI reference in a non-Link field or custom field.
- ❌ Requires data migration
- ❌ Less intuitive for users

### Option 3: Current Solution (IMPLEMENTED) ✅
Add `ignore_links` flag and clear link on deletion.
- ✅ No schema changes needed
- ✅ Preserves Link field benefits
- ✅ Follows ERPNext patterns (`before_cancel` already does this)
- ✅ Minimal code changes

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Users can now delete draft PI and PE without errors
- **Data Integrity**: Links are properly cleaned up, workflow state remains consistent
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes, existing functionality preserved
- **Performance**: Negligible impact (one extra DB query to clear link per deletion)

## Notes

- This fix only affects **draft** documents (docstatus = 0)
- Submitted documents still require proper cancellation workflow
- The bidirectional link between PI/PE and ER is maintained for submitted docs
