## Deployment Steps (15 minutes)

### Test Environment First
```bash
# 1. SSH to test server
ssh user@test.imogi.com

# 2. Deploy code
cd ~/frappe-bench/apps/imogi_finance
git pull origin develop

# 3. Restart
cd ~/frappe-bench
bench --site test.imogi.com migrate
bench --site test.imogi.com clear-cache
bench --site test.imogi.com restart
```

- [ ] Test site loads
- [ ] Upload standard 11% invoice → Approved ✅
- [ ] Upload export invoice (0%) → **Approved ✅ (NEW!)**
- [ ] Check logs → No errors

### Production Deployment
**⚠️ Run during low-traffic hours (2-4 AM)**

```bash
# 1. Enable maintenance mode
ssh user@imogi.com
cd ~/frappe-bench
bench --site imogi.com set-maintenance-mode on

# 2. Deploy code
cd apps/imogi_finance
git pull origin main

# 3. Restart
cd ~/frappe-bench
bench --site imogi.com migrate
bench --site imogi.com clear-cache
bench --site imogi.com restart

# 4. Disable maintenance mode
bench --site imogi.com set-maintenance-mode off
```

- [ ] Production site loads
- [ ] Test with standard invoice → Works
- [ ] Monitor logs for 5 minutes → No errors
- [ ] Check server resources → Normal

---

## Post-Deployment Verification (15 minutes)

### Functional Tests
- [ ] **Export Invoice Test:** Upload Faktur 020 → Status "Approved" ✅
- [ ] **Standard 11% Test:** Process normally → No regression ✅
- [ ] **Standard 12% Test:** Process normally → No regression ✅
- [ ] **Performance Test:** Average < 70ms → Faster ✅

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Grafana dashboard showing metrics
- [ ] Alerts configured and firing tests
- [ ] Error tracking showing structured errors
- [ ] Zero-rated transaction counter active

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Export invoices approve automatically (was failing before)
- [ ] Processing time < 70ms (was 100ms before)
- [ ] No new critical errors in logs
- [ ] Approval rate maintained or improved

## Quick Rollback (If Needed)

**If export invoices still failing OR standard invoices breaking:**

```bash
# 1. Enable maintenance
bench --site imogi.com set-maintenance-mode on

# 2. Rollback code
cd ~/frappe-bench/apps/imogi_finance
git checkout <PREVIOUS_COMMIT>  # Get from git log

# 3. Restart
cd ~/frappe-bench
bench --site imogi.com restart
bench --site imogi.com set-maintenance-mode off

# 4. Notify team immediately
```

**Rollback Decision:** On-call engineer or DevOps lead

## Quick SQL Checks

**Check export invoices are working:**
```sql
-- Should return ZERO rows (all should be approved now)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM `tabTax Invoice`
WHERE faktur_type LIKE '020%'
    AND status != 'Approved'
    AND creation >= NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
```

**Check zero-rated detection:**
```sql
-- Should return COUNT of export invoices
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM `tabTax Invoice`
WHERE tax_rate = 0.0
    AND ppn = 0
    AND creation >= NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
```

**Check performance:**
```sql
-- Average processing time (should be < 70ms)
SELECT AVG(processing_time_ms)
FROM `tabTax Invoice`
WHERE creation >= NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
```
